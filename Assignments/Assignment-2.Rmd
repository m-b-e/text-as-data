## Parsing XML text data

In this assignment we will access and work with German Parliamentary data, which is available in XML format [here](https://www.bundestag.de/services/opendata) (scroll down) for the last two parliamentary periods. Remember XML format is very like HTML format, and we can parse it using a scraper and CSS selectors. Speeches are contained in `<rede>` elements, which each contain a paragraph element describing the speaker, and paragraph elements recording what they said.

### 1.1 

Choose one of the sessions, and retrieve it using R or Python. 

### 1.2 

Using a scraper, get a list of all the <rede> elements. 

### 1.3 

For each element, get the name of the speaker, and a single string containing everything that they said. Put this into a dataframe. 

### 2.1 

Choose a politician, and print the number of speeches they made in this session

### 2.2 

Print the content of the first speech by the politician you choose.

### 2.3 

Process the list of speeches into a TFIDF matrix. What are the highest scoring terms in this matrix for the first speech by the politician you have chosen?

### 2.4 

Using the resource "Stammdaten aller Abgeordneten seit 1949 im XML-Format", retrieve the records pertaining to your chosen politician and print the information they contain.
